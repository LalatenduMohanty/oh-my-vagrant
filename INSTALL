Won't someone contribute a good vagrant+vagrant-libvirt installation guide?
For two (original, and out of date) articles on the subject, please read:

https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/05/13/vagrant-on-fedora-with-libvirt-reprise/

(The second one is more up to date, and mostly replaces the first...)

In Fedora 21+ Vagrant and Vagrant-Libvirt should be included in the distro.

In Fedora 22+ Oh-My-Vagrant is now available as a COPR:

Happy Hacking!
